# DataHackathon
Working Prototype for Northeastern's Data Hackathon 2023


Save the trained model: You can save the trained model using the save() method of the Word2Vec class. This will save the entire model, including the vocabulary and the trained word embeddings, to a file in binary format. You can then load the model later using the load() method.

Save the word vectors: If you only need the word embeddings and not the entire model, you can save the word vectors to a file using the save_word2vec_format() method of the KeyedVectors class. This will save the word vectors in a plain text format that can be easily read by other programs. You can then load the vectors later using the load_word2vec_format() method.

Process the word vectors: Once you have the word embeddings, you can perform various operations on them, such as calculating similarity between words, clustering words, or using them as input to a machine learning model. The KeyedVectors class provides various methods for these operations, such as similarity(), most_similar(), similarity_matrix() and distance_matrix(). You can also use popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch to further process the embeddings for your specific task.

Visualize the word vectors: If you want to visualize the word embeddings, you can use tools like t-SNE, PCA or UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of the vectors to 2 or 3 dimensions, and then plot them using a scatter plot. You can also use libraries like gensim, pyLDAvis, TensorFlow Embedding Projector, or UMAP-learn to create interactive visualizations that allow you to explore the embeddings and discover patterns in the data.
